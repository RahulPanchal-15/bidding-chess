Bidding Chess is a crypto-based bidding game where players can bid on chess moves they make. The game is available to everyone in the world and can be played on the Ropsten Test Network.
Here are some of the key features of Bidding Chess:
 * Players can bid on chess moves they make.
 * The state of the chess game is available to everyone in the world.
 * Once a player makes a move, they are fixed to the play from that side only.
 * After making a move, the player can wait for someone else to play from the other side, or they can just share the game with their friends and ask them to play with their account.
 * If your side eventually wins, you receive all the ether you had bid and extra rewards from the loser pool. These rewards are divided equally in Ether and an ERC-20 token UBI!
 * These UBI tokens can then be used to play the chess game instead of using Ether.
